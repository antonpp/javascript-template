# JavaScript 

this repository is for reading and learning javascript, if you're a total beginner or a pro coming from another language.  You can use this repo as a reference and checklist as you cover the JavaScript language. To understand each piece of the language you will collect clear examples, study them carefully, and organize your analyses into your own personal JavaScript language reference.

(this table of contents is just a starter, feel free to modify it and expand it as your understanding of JS grows)

## Variables

In JavaScript, variables act as _pointers_.  They point to something (primitives, objects, funcitons, ...) in memory so you can get back to it later. 
One variables can point to any type of data and can be changed to point to anything else at any time.  

Examples:
* [Hoisting - let, var, named functions, anonymous functions](./studied-examples/hoisting-1.md)

Variables Resources:
* [Hoisting by example (functions)](https://gist.github.com/maxogden/4bed247d9852de93c94c)
